# Generative AI Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository contains my personal learning journey through Generative AI concepts, techniques, and applications. It includes both handwritten notes and practical code implementations that I developed while studying various aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and other generative AI technologies.

## Repository Structure

### Handwritten Notes
Detailed notes covering key concepts in generative AI:
- LLM app deployment using AWS, Git, and Docker
- LLMOps with Google Vertex AI and AWS Bedrock
- Building LLMs from scratch - core concepts and architecture

### Projects and implementations

#### 1. NLP Fundamentals
- Text preprocessing techniques and pipelines
- Word embedding models and implementations
- Text classification using machine learning approaches

#### 2. Complete AI Applications
- Medical chatbot with domain-specific knowledge
- Source code analysis system using LLMs
- Interactive applications built with Chainlit

#### 3. Model Fine-tuning
- Llama2 model customization and optimization

#### 4. Hugging Face Integration
- Text-to-image generation workflows
- Text summarization implementations
- Text-to-speech conversion systems

#### 5. LLMOps
- RAG implementations with AWS Bedrock
- Chatbot deployment and management
- Google Vertex AI integration examples

#### 6. Retrieval Augmented Generation
- RAG architecture implementations
- Gemini-based RAG systems
