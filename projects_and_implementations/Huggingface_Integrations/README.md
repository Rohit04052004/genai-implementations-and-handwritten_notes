# Hugging Face Integrations

This directory contains notebooks and projects that demonstrate how to leverage the Hugging Face ecosystem for various AI tasks.

## Projects

### 1. Text_to_Image_Generation_Pipeline.ipynb
A notebook demonstrating how to use Hugging Face's Diffusion models for text-to-image generation:
- Stable Diffusion implementation
- Prompt engineering for image generation
- Parameter tuning for quality control
- Image post-processing techniques

### 2. HF_Platform_Exploration.ipynb

- Model Hub navigation and usage
- Datasets library integration
- Spaces exploration
- API authentication and usage limits
- Community features

### 3. Document_Summarization_Engine.ipynb
Implementation of a text summarization system using Hugging Face models:
- Extractive vs. abstractive summarization
- Model selection and comparison
- Evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BLEU)
- Fine-tuning for domain-specific summarization

### 4. Speech_Synthesis_System.ipynb
A text-to-speech generation system using Hugging Face audio models:
- Speech synthesis model selection
- Voice customization options
- Multi-language support
- Audio quality optimization

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Transformers library
- Datasets library
- Diffusers library (for image generation)
- Hugging Face account and API token

## Usage
Each notebook can be run in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Make sure to install the required dependencies and set up your Hugging Face API token as instructed in the notebooks.
